<h3> Why I love The Wizard of Oz</h3>
<p> I love the Wizard of Oz because my dad and I would watch it when I was younger. In fact many of the movies I love I watched with my dad as a child. A fond memory I have is spraying the TV with a spray bottle from my seat because I was scared of the Wicked Witch and she melts with water. My fond memories of this movie makes it a movie I go towards now in my adult life.
