<p> Now that you know about my favorite movies and books as well as a little bit about my favorite food and colors I will tell you about myself and my life! I am a junior studying Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also recieving certificates in Gender and Women's Studies, Digital Studies and Leadership. In my time away from school I am the Culture Editor for Moda Magazine and I dance for a student organization called Optima.
  I also enjoy cooking, reading, painting, hanging with friends, being outside and working out!

<h3> Here are some paintings I have done in my free time! </h3>
